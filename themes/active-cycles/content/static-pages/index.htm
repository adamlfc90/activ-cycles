intro_text = "<p>In October 2014 we moved premises to Gresham House on Watling Street, Corbridge. We have combined both of our passions, bikes and food! We are now a Coffee and Bike shop. This is the only one of it's kind in Northumberland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will have a standard table menu offering everything from our own recipe sausage made by our local butcher WHM Farm fresh meats from Haydon Bridge, bacon butties, freshly made sandwiches to a specials board than changes to suit the season, with offerings from hot kiln roasted salmon, asparagus, baby gem, broad bean and baby gem salad with a citrus dressing to our own recipe British Lamb kufta wraps. All our cakes are made by us in the kitchen along with our Activ Chutneys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shop is in the village of Corbridge and we have a passion for custom building bikes from No.22 Titanium framesets from Canada and the well know UK brand Kinesis. In addition to our custom builds we have a fully equipped workshop and and more than happy to service any make or model of bikes. At ActivCycles we are passionate about everything in cycling and love nothing better than providing a friendly, helpful and efficient service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We only stock the what we think is the best in the market place from bikes to clothing to accessories and parts and have usually tried and tested most of our products in-store so you can be sure you will be provided with the most up to date informative advice for your cycling needs.</p>"
